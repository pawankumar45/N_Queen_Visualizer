Technologies/Frameworks use :Reactjs, JavaScript,Visualisation,chess-queens, Data-Structure.

This is a react simulation of solving nqueen using backtracking algorithm.

Solved the n-queens puzzle by successfully placing N queens on an N x N chessboard.

Ensured non-attacking positions for queens, maintaining optimal placement and strategic arrangement.

Given an integer N(user input),we will show all distinct solutions to the N-queens puzzle.

Utilized Recursion and BackTracking in the design of this algorithm for optimal performance.
